ERTS (E-Sport Results Tracking System) is a web application project designed to visualize statistics and results from e-sports competitions. The goal of the application is to provide a clear interface for users who want to track statistics from e-sports games, such as League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2, Overwatch, and Valorant. The project also includes a module for automatically fetching and updating data.
